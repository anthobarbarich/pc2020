For campers, Paradise City is more than just a music festival, it is also a camping experience. Along with a rising sunshine and star-lit night skies, the intimate setting welcomes a fantastic crowd of music lovers.

<br><br>

We all know there’s nothing better than having a refreshing (hot) shower followed by a good coffee and a delicious breakfast, while listening to that guy who was playing piano – remember last year? – or maybe you were the one that woke up, unlocked his sweet little tent and saw his best mates already drinking an opened Carapils can… You took a sip too, kicking off the day. Anyway, you’re feeling ready to start another day of carefully selected electronic music. Our campsite is a true slice of Paradise 😏 And after an intense day of music, get a last and final beer at the camping bar.

The camping will be your personal eco-friendly chill-out area in the midst of festival insanity. There are **different options to overnight** **at Paradise City**, from pre-pitched tents or glamping options to caravans. Let’s explore them below.

_(Please, note that you won’t be allowed on the campsite without a valid camping ticket)_

## Glamping options

<br><br>

These onsite glamping options are the absolute ultimate in cool and comfort. These shiny tents are 2, 4 or 5-person size dome tents and all have cosy beds, electricity and light. Outside it, you can relax in deckchairs and watch the stars at night. These are the perfect options for those who wish something different and want to add some style, comfort and fun to their festival experience.

These camping packages can be booked along with your festival tickets through our website.

Paradise City wasnâ€™t built by itself. Itâ€™s the result of hard work by countless volunteers months before the due date, during and even after the festival. Together, we envision what a city of the future can look like with people working hand in hand to create something truly special.

For every citizen on the dancefloor having the time of his life, **thereâ€™s someone making it happen behind the curtains**. As a volunteer, you are super precious to us, as youâ€™re on site and you directly represent the festival to our festivalgoers. You can get involved in nearly all the activities needed to make Paradise City run flawlessly, from the build up before the festival to the breakdown after it. During the festival you can get involved at the info booth, the camping, the kitchens or the bar, the activities are countless and thatâ€™s why **we need YOU!**

Engage yourself and do not hesitate ðŸ˜‰

## **You choose, we adapt**

Depending on your motivation and availability, you can help out for 1 day and up to 3 weeks.

Working as a volunteer is also a great opportunity to learn about Paradise City from the inside out, to get out of your daily routine, sharpen your skills and develop new ones, and create special bonds with your fellow volunteers. Learn how to work in a team, discover a new universe, meet new people, and of course have lots of fun! You'll see, the people and atmosphere are insanely chill.

With over **600 dedicated people** working throughout the summer, we definitely need all the helping hands there are to make it happen!

## What can you expect from us?

* Free entrance to the festival
* A 30â‚¬ credit/day/person (during the festival)
* A 34â‚¬ compensation per day of working on build up and breakdown
* A unique Paradise City T-shirt
* A unique mug/eco-cup/drinking cup from Paradise City catering

Got **_free time in June_**, a lot of **_energy and_** **_motivation_** and a desire to **_make something cool_**? We guarantee a great experience!

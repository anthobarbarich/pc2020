We've missed you… But in the past few months, we've been working on something that will give us a chance to reconnect. On July 1st and 2nd, we’ll be live streaming from the beautiful domain of Ribaucourt with some carefully selected artists and in presence of 200 lucky citizens per day. A kind of intimate edition of Paradise City.

On this special occasion, **_200 lucky citizens_** per day will be able to attend the event for free and enjoy live concerts and DJ-sets, from boats. These boats will allow people to participate in the event in a corona proof way.

Winners will be able to choose 7 of their friends to share their boat with (only from your restricted 10-person bubble)! They will be contacted by e-mail next week!

**LIVE STREAM**

Due to the very limited capacity of the live event, we have worked with Accenture Interactive to push barriers and connect with as many citizens as possible. This year’s festival will also take place as an **interactive livestream event** that everyone can experience together on virtual boats. Create a boat and invite your friends to a private viewing party! More information available soon!

This event was made possible thanks to our partners :

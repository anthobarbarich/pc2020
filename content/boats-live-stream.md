Dear citizens,

We've been working on something that will give us a chance to reconnect. On July 1st and 2nd, we’ll be livestreaming from the beautiful domain of Ribaucourt with some carefully selected artists in presence of 200 lucky citizens. A kind of small festival **_on boats_**.

On this special occasion, **_200 contest winners_** will be able to attend for free and live concerts and DJ-sets, from a boat. These boats will allow people to participate in the event in a corona proof way.

Grab your chance to win a place on the boat by subscribing **here**. 

Winners will be able to choose the 7 people who will join them on the boat - only from their restricted 10-person lockdown bubble (family, roommates, close friends). We will ask the lucky winners to share their guests’ names in advance so we can verify.

The event will be streamed online from 6 to 10pm via a dedicated platform created by Accenture interactive, in which you and your friends can hop on virtual boats and chat while enjoying the stream.

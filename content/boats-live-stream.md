Dear citizens,

We've missed you... But in the past few months, we've been working on something that will give us a chance to reconnect. On July 1st and 2nd, we’ll be live streaming from the beautiful domain of Ribaucourt with some carefully selected artists and in presence of 200 lucky citizens per day. A kind of intimate edition of Paradise City.

On this special occasion, **_200 lucky citizens_** per day will be able to attend the event for free and enjoy live concerts and DJ-sets, from boats. These boats will allow people to participate in the event in a corona proof way.

Winners will be able to choose 7 of their friends to share their boat with (only from your restricted 10-person bubble)! They will be contacted by e-mail next week!

**Wednesday July 1st**

* Âme (live)
* DTM Funk
* Leafar Legov (Giegling)

**Thursday July 2nd**

* Beraadgeslagen
* Charlotte Adigéry
* Lola Haro

Grab your chance to win a boat for you and your friends! Winners will be contacted by e-mail next week!

**LIVE STREAM**

Because of the very limited capacity, we wanted to push the barriers and be able to connect with as many citizens as possible. That’s why we will live stream the event via a dedicated platform created by Accenture interactive, in which friends can hop on virtual boats, invite friends and chat with them while enjoying the stream. More info on this next week!

This event was made possible thanks to our partners :

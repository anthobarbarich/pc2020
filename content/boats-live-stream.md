Dear citizens,

We've been working on something that will give us a chance to reconnect. On July 1st and 2nd, we’ll be livestreaming from the beautiful domain of Ribaucourt with some carefully selected artists in presence of 400 lucky citizens. A kind of small festival **_on boats_**.

Line-up: 

**ÂME (Live) - BERAADGESLAGEN - CHARLOTTE ADIGÉRY - DTM FUNK - LEAFAR LEGOV - LOLA HARO**

On this special occasion, **_400 contest winners_** will be able to attend for free and live concerts and DJ-sets, from a boat. These boats will allow people to participate in the event in a corona proof way.

Winners will be able to choose the 7 people who will join them on the boat - only from their restricted 10-person lockdown bubble (family, roommates, close friends).

The event will be streamed online from 6 to 10pm via a dedicated platform created by Accenture interactive, in which you and your friends can hop on virtual boats and chat while enjoying the stream.

Grab your chance to win a place on the boat!

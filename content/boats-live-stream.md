Dear citizens,

We've been working on something that will give us a chance to reconnect. On July 1st and 2nd, we’ll be livestreaming from the beautiful domain of Ribaucourt with some carefully selected artists in presence of 200 lucky citizens.

Small festival with boats on the water of the estate of Ribaucourt in Perk. On this special occasion, **_200 contest winners_** will be able to attend for free and live concerts and DJ-sets, from a boat. These boats will allow people to participate in the event in a corona proof way.

All you need to do is to suscribe and try to win a place on the boat. Winners will be able to choose the 7 people who will join them on the boat - only from their restricted 10-person lockdown bubble (family, roommates, close friends). We will ask the lucky winners to share their guests’ names in advance so we can verify.

The event will take place from 6 to 10pm and will be streamed online via a dedicated platform created by Accenture interactive, in which friends can hop on virtual boats, invite friends and chat with them while enjoying the stream.

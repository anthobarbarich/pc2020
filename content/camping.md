**For campers, Paradise City is more than just a music festival, it is also a camping experience. Along with a rising sunshine and star-lit night skies, the intimate setting welcomes a fantastic crowd of music lovers.**

We all know there’s nothing better than having a refreshing (hot) shower followed by a good coffee and a delicious breakfast, while listening to that guy who was playing piano – remember last year? – or maybe you were the one that woke up, unlocked his sweet little tent and saw his best mates already drinking an opened Carapils can… You took a sip too, kicking off the day. Anyway, you’re feeling ready to start another day of carefully selected electronic music. Our campsite is a true slice of Paradise 😏 And after an intense day of music, get a last and final beer at the camping bar.

The camping will be your personal eco-friendly chill-out area in the midst of festival insanity. There are **different options to overnight** **at Paradise City**, from pre-pitched tents or glamping options to caravans. Let’s explore them below.

_(Please, note that you won’t be allowed on the campsite without a valid camping ticket)_

### For those of you who wish to bring their own tent and camping equipment

Here you take your own tent with you. The camping is located next to the festival site, it is secure and serene with good facilities such as food stalls, bars, fresh drinking water and super sanitary services (high-quality WCs and hot showers). Don’t forget to bring your own towel! Lockers will be available for rent. No matter what you have forgotten at home, we will help you out of the trouble. At the campsite, you can easily rent camping items such as sleeping bags or air mattresses.

To access the campsite, there are two possibilities:

* You can buy a 3 days-ticket + **camping**
* Or you can just buy a camping ticket for **35€** (1 ticket per person)

The camping has a limited capacity and was sold out a couple of weeks before the festival last year so please, be sure to book your ticket in time to avoid any disappointment.

### **Campers and caravans**

Campers and caravans can be parked in the Camper area with a separate ticket for **40€**. This ticket will only be valid in combination with a camping ticket. Water and electricity are supplied for your campers on the caravan pitch.

Please, think twice about buying a cheap throwaway tent that will only contribute to landfill and use our pre-pitched option :-)

_The campsite will be open from Friday 14.00 to Monday 12.00._

steps:
- title: 1. Green Energy
  description: Green energy lowers the impact of lighting & music. We encourage everyone
    involved in the festival to be aware of how much energy they use, while measuring,
    monitoring and reporting each year on energy usage. The last 2 editions were powered
    up only by renewable energy & using low consumption lightning on site.

- title: 2. Future Food
  description: Future food consists of 100 % locally sourced & organically grown food
    and ingredients from fair-trade source. Because of meat’s high climate & environmental
    impact, we propose a large range of vegetarian & meat free meals from our food
    providers. Menus are discussed internally in order to offer large & balanced alternatives.
    We also try to adapt food quantity to avoid leftovers.

- title: 3. Waste Management
  description: Waste Management allows us, with our visitors’ participation, to sort,
    recycle and compost our waste. In order to minimize our waste stream, we have
    a “Zero single-used plastic” policy & we provide reusable cups for all drinks.
    We are also trying to implement a circular economy in regards with the waste generated
    by the festival.

  description: 'Transport modes have the biggest impact on our carbon footprint. So
    how will you get here? We are providing a parking near the entrance for sustainable
    transport modes with our bicycle point. We promote Carpooling and Public transports:
    the more people share a car or public transport, the lower the carbon footprint
    per passenger, the lower the carbon footprint per festival resident.'
- title: 5. Filtered Tap Water
  description: 'Filtered tap water is available to avoid a wave of plastic water bottles
    which usually submerges festivals. Meet our less lucrative but more responsible
    alternative: Paradise City still & sparkling Tap Water.'

- title: 6. Sustainable Communication
  description: 'Sustainable communication is considered whenever applicable: we use
    only FSC paper for all our communication on paper (flyers, posters …), which we
    try to cut down. And no tokens, it’s a cashless festival. As for our internet
    site, we make sure it is the lightest possible to avoid any negative environmental
    impact.'

- title: 7. WATER
  img: "/v1580761013/water2_lcputz.svg"
  description: Water is a valuable good of nature that is spread on festival ground
    as our visitors must rehydrate, eat and (optionally) shower. For a second year
    in a row, we intent to purify on site the water used in our showers, reducing
    treatment as much as possible. And with the use of our eco-toilets, we intent
    to reduce any excessive water usage.
- title: 8. CO2 Neutral
  description: A CO2-Neutral festival is a goal we have achieved year after year.
    We are aware that even after all our efforts, there is a remaining climate impact.
    Taking our responsibility, we offset the unavoidable climate impact through the
    support of CO2logic’s climate project.

- title: 9. Camping
  description: Camping has always been an ecological issue for festivals, mainly regarding
    all the waste left over. We have been working on the problem since our first edition
    and will implement for the second time in a row our circular camping where each
    camper has the opportunity to rent recycled camping gear, how cool is that?

- title: 10. Awareness
  description: Awareness of the importance of a sustainable way of life is enhanced
    and communicated to our suppliers, partners and sponsors, to assure they share
    our concerns about a greener future. And we give you useful sustainable tips on
    the site of the festival.

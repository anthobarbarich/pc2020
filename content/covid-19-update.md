We are extremely sad that Paradise City will not be taking place this June. We are very disappointed about this but it’s for the best. In the meantime, we’re already focussed on 2021 in order to give you the best possible festival experience while maintaining our commitment to limit our environmental footprint. This is a severe blow for our organisation and we hope we can count on your support for the future. Of course, all tickets will be valid for next year.

**Here are some FAQ about your purchased tickets :**

**When will Paradise City take place in 2021?**

Dates for 2021 are 25, 26 & 27th of June.

**What do I need to do if I have a ticket and want to come in 2021?**

All tickets purchased will automatically be valid for next year, you don’t need to do anything, just keep your tickets in your mailbox.

**I want to come next year but I’m not sure I can come on the same day(s), how can I do that?**

If you want to come next year but you are not sure which day or if you want to switch to the full journey, you can now request a voucher [here](https://consumer.paylogic.nl/request-order-access/). That voucher will have the same value as your ticket and you’ll be able to use it in our ticket shop on all the products and for all the merchandising we’ll release soon.

**When will this voucher option be available?**

The interface is now ready and you can request your voucher [here](https://consumer.paylogic.nl/request-order-access/).

**I would like to give (a part of) my ticket value to the festival!**

We know many of your will also be financially affected by this crisis. But if you have the means to support our project and donate to Paradise City that would be highly appreciated. The reality is that our organisation will be in a severe financial turmoil, all our income will evaporate and already many costs for organising the 2020 edition have been made. Also there is no insurance to cover this pandemic. Those donations will be exclusively used for green initiatives at the festival in 2021. As a token of appreciation, we will list all our supporters on our Hall of Fame that will be visible at the entrance of Paradise City 2021. The option to donate is featured in the [voucher system](https://consumer.paylogic.nl/request-order-access/).

**What do I need to do about personalizing my ticket?**

This is not necessary at the moment. We will keep you updated about this later on.

**I bought an e-ticket via Ticketswap.**

Tickets purchased via Ticketswap also remain valid for next year.

**I won a ticket through a contest or a giveaway.**

If you won a ticket through our channels no worries, you will get a free ticket for next year’s edition. If you won a ticket through another channel, please contact them directly.

**I purchased an accommodation for this edition, what do I need to do?**

Of course the accommodations you purchased will be valid for next year, you don’t need to do anything about it.

If you’re not sure you’ll need the same accommodation next year you can request a voucher and use it to shop on our webshop next year! You can access the system to request your voucher [here](https://consumer.paylogic.nl/request-order-access/).

**I’m a Paradise City Ambassador (Verve) and want to know what will happen with my rewards?**

First of all, we want to thank you for your enthusiasm so far! We’re still working on a solution together with Verve but your points will be valid for next year’s program, prices and rewards will keep the same value. More info will be shared on the right channels, keep an eye on the Facebook group!

**What’s the voucher worth?**

The voucher you request has the same value as your previous order, that means the price of the ticket, the service costs and the transaction costs. You can use that voucher to choose products in our webshop for Paradise City 2021 or 2022 and for all the merchandising we’ll release soon.

For example, you can ask a voucher for your Saturday ticket and use it to buy a weekend ticket. You’ll have to add the difference in value of course.

**Until when can I use this voucher?**

This voucher will only be valid for Paradise City 2021 and Paradise City 2022. Of course, the voucher is only valid for tickets that are not sold out so don’t hesitate to use it as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.

**What does this voucher look like?**

When requested you’ll receive a unique code by email that you’ll be able to enter in our webshop when ticket sale starts.

**I really can’t make it to Paradise City 2021, what can I do?**

That’s too bad but we understand. You can always sell your ticket to a friend or on Ticketswap. That way you’re helping us ensure Paradise City will exist next year. You bought the ticket at green card or early bird value, so it should be fairly easy to sell your ticket on Ticketswap. If you really need your money back please contact us at info@paradisecity.be before the 8th of June 2020 (also possible per ticket)

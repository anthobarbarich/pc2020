Every year, we partner up with stage hosts to select the line up and create a memorable experience for you. They represent part of the local scene and are the ones that make you dance week after week.

Sadly, they have all been affected by the coronavirus crisis in the past months. Many beautiful projects on which they have been working for months had to be cancelled and now they need our support.

"The lockdown... Honestly, it has 2 sides for me: + and - . On the minus side, I sometimes felt a bit lonely and didn't know how to handle my 'empty weekends' a the beginning of the lockdown. But this changed after a few weeks and the plus side gained over the downside. I started to valuate even more friendship and appreciate more 'normal day to day conversations' with friends. I guess I even have more contact now with them than before. As I have more time on my hands during the time my friends are 'off' from work, I'm able to spend more time with them... so, this opens my eyes towards the future. On music level, I also only see positive sides, cause it made me explore other aspects in music, more downtempo, out of the box things. The result will be soon/heard released and I think it summarizes perfectly what the lockdown means to be. Another final plus is the fact that I'm definitely craving to be in front of a fully packed dance floor. The fact that I miss this sooooo much, means that I'm really loving my job. So I appreciate and valuate my 'job' even more than before. 

Can only just hope everything goes into the right direction and we can all dance together again. Was mega looking forward to host the beautiful 'golden sunset' stage on Sunday again. But let's look at it from the bright side. There is always... another year, cause ... good things will stay forever. Paradise City is there to stay and I'm not planning to go neither. So dear PCF citizens, keep the faith and be kind to each other as you always did. One big happy family ❤️

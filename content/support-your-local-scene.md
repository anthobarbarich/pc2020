Every year, we partner up with stage hosts to select the line up and create a memorable experience for you. They represent part of the local scene and are the ones that make you dance week after week.

Sadly, they have all been affected by the coronavirus crisis in the past months. Many beautiful projects on which they have been working for months had to be cancelled and now they need our support.

**NICO MORANO & Friends**

"The lockdown... Honestly, it has 2 sides for me: + and - . On the minus side, I sometimes felt a bit lonely and didn't know how to handle my 'empty weekends' a the beginning of the lockdown. But this changed after a few weeks and the plus side gained over the downside. I started to valuate even more friendship and appreciate more 'normal day to day conversations' with friends. I guess I even have more contact now with them than before. As I have more time on my hands during the time my friends are 'off' from work, I'm able to spend more time with them... so, this opens my eyes towards the future. On music level, I also only see positive sides, cause it made me explore other aspects in music, more downtempo, out of the box things. The result will be soon/heard released and I think it summarizes perfectly what the lockdown means to be. Another final plus is the fact that I'm definitely craving to be in front of a fully packed dance floor. The fact that I miss this sooooo much, means that I'm really loving my job. So I appreciate and valuate my 'job' even more than before.

Can only just hope everything goes into the right direction and we can all dance together again. Was mega looking forward to host the beautiful 'golden sunset' stage on Sunday again. But let's look at it from the bright side. There is always... another year, cause ... good things will stay forever. Paradise City is there to stay and I'm not planning to go neither. So dear PCF citizens, keep the faith and be kind to each other as you always did. One big happy family ❤️"

"Like all of us, the uncertainty of the situation for our sector was enormous. Suddenly there was time in abundance, I immediately realised that nature was screaming to slow down, to change our approach, that this pace and especially the way was not the right way.  With the time granted, I rediscovered my record collection and gave my usb playlist a huge upgrade, so it's bursting with new tunes...! 

The clearer it became that the virus has such an impact on health and the economy, the more difficult it became for our sector to plan ahead and make something out of this summer. Especially the consequences following the summer will be disastrous and decisive for many of us.  

We are all creative and supportive, hands have been handed out from unexpected angles to work together. Personally, this gave me a lot of courage not to let myself be caught by shouting that we are in trouble and are the victims. Yes, we're in the middle of it, but it doesn't help us if we keep getting caught.  

So there are some challenges ahead: the biggest challenge I'm going to take on is as sound director for Sonhouse (sound agency located in Brussels) which will focus on the fashion and lifestyle world.  Furthermore, there are some ideas bubbling up, so I can't say anything about that yet..."

## BY BIKE

It goes without saying that we recommend you to use your bike or public transport to get to the festival. The bike racks will be lit at night.

Go to <http://fietsnet.be> and follow the junctions to our festival, from your location. Our festival is located in Perk, right next to junction 56.  Whilst on the road you don’t have to worry about anything but to follow the signs on your chosen route to the festival.

**Address: Kasteelhoekstraat 1, Perk, Belgium**

## Where can I park?

Several parking areas will be available.

In an effort to incentivize people to **carpool** the price for the parking will be **5€ more expensive** if you arrive with **less than 3 people** in a car. 

Before entering the centre of Perk you will be able to access a protected parking area on your right hand side. Follow the parking signs. The entrance of the parking is situated on the split of the Tervuursesteenweg and Perksesteenweg in Perk. 

## BY TRAIN

This year we're working with our partner **Brussels Airport** who will provide electric shuttle busses that will bring you from the **Vilvoorde train station** to our doors. After the festival the shuttle will bring you to the **Vilvoorde train station** and then to the **Brussels Airport train station.**

**From Brussels with Brussels Airport electric busses**

Busses from Brussels are free of charge, thanks to our partner **Brussels Airport**, but you still need to get a **ticket** on our shop at 5€. That amount will be put in credits on your wristband upon your arrival at the festival. Watch out, because of the Tour the France,  our bus shuttles will leave from **Roodebeek** (accessible with Metro 1 Stockel from Central Station). 

After the festival the bus shuttles will drop people at **Central Station** with a stop at **Roodebeek** for the ones who left their means of transport there.

Good news, MIVB/STIB tickets will be free during the whole weekend! (6 & 7 July)

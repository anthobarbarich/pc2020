2019 marks our 5th anniversary and our excitement is mounting
to deliver the most special edition to date. The Paradise City
recipe has been quite simple from the start in 2015: mix the
best electronic music on offer with an open minded crowd and a
strong effort to minimize our ecological footprint. 

For our 5th birthday we want to impress our music loving
community with a very special line-up. We also want to surprise
you by making some bold changes to the festival site. But we
can’t reveal it all here.

**The countdown has begun… come and join us!**

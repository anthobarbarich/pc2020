**Brussels Airport** is a proud sponsor & sustainability partner of Paradise City and to help us reach our green ambitions, they will use 4 electric buses to transport visitors between the festival and Brussels/Vilvoorde during the 3 festival days. It is estimated that around 600 festival-goers will use this shuttle service every day.

The shuttles from Vilvoorde train station and to Brussels Airport train station are free and do not necessit a ticket. 

The ones that will leave from Brussels require a ticket. We are charging 5€ for the ticket on our shop but it will be put in credit on your wristband upon your arrival at the festival.

## **Tour de France**

This year Brussels hosts the Tour de France on Saturday 6 & 7 July during Paradise City. Therefore our bus shuttles will leave from **Roodebeek** (accessible with Metro 1 Stockel from Central Station). 

After the festival the bus shuttles will drop people at **Central Station** with a stop at **Roodebeek** for the ones who left their means of transport there.

Good news, **MIVB/STIB** tickets will be free during the whole weekend! (6 & 7 July)

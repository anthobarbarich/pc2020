Dear beloved Citizens,

We are having a very tough time right now. After the cancellation of our festival due to Covid-19 we were able to organize a tiny edition of Paradise City on Boats. This was fun and only possible thanks to the support from our loyal partners to make sure the event ended up break-even. For August, our team was working intensely on a new project, a new concept, a small festival on a different location in Belgium with a different vibe from Paradise City which was safe to organize. We managed to get a permit and we were super enthusiastic about this new event. Unfortunately we had to cancel the whole project because of the new measures put in place by the Belgian government end of July. This is a second blow and very difficult to swallow.

Of course we understand the health concerns, but the event and cultural sector are being treated unfairly, there is almost no governmental support while we are not allowed to operate. This means in our case that our entire income has disappeared.

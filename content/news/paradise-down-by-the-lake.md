## **Paradise Down by the Lake**

#### 10-13 & 17-20 September l Domain Calmeyn - Drogenbos

Paradise Down by the Lake is as emotionally stirring as it is mentally evocative, it’s an experience that brings together sound design & cinematic ideas to recreate a multi-sensory exploration that puts you as the central character in an expressive musical world.

The journey will take place on a beautiful private lake during 8 sessions, each time between 5 pm and 11 pm on weekdays and between 2 pm and 10 pm on weekends. From rafts within your bubble and on a safe distance from other bubbles you will be able to enjoy gentle music and a picknick within a rustic environment.

**Find Yourself.**

With the Tour de France happening during the weekend of 6 & 7 July in Brussels it won’t be easy to travel from Brussels to Paradise City. But we have arranged several options for you…

## BY BUS

Electric busses given by Brussels Airport will bring you from Roodebeek station to Paradise City. After the festival the bus shuttles will drop people at Central Station with a stop at Roodebeek for the ones who left their means of transport there.

## BY TRAIN

If option above is sold out, take a train to **Vilvoorde train station**. There will be **free shuttles** from Vilvoorde station to Paradise City. After the festival the shuttle will bring you to the **Vilvoorde train station** and then to the **Brussels Airport train station**.

## BY SHARED TAXI

We partnered up with **Taxis Verts**, so you can easily order a taxi via their smartphone application. Share a taxi with friends and get **15 € discount** on your order via the Taxis Verts’ app with promo code **PARADISECITY**. 

## BY CARPOOL

Carpooling is a greener way to commute than coming alone in your car. Please check our carpooling options with Covevent here : <https://my.covevent.be/paradisecity2019>

## BY CAR

If you decide to come by car, please be aware that in an effort to incentivize people to carpool, the price for the parking will be **5€ more expensive if you arrive with less than 3 people in a car.**

  question: WHAT ARE THE FESTIVAL OPENING HOURS?
- answer: 'Right here : https://paradisecity.be/timetable/friday'
  question: WHERE CAN I FIND THE LINE-UP?
- answer: "People with wheelchairs get free access to the comfort area. There’s a
    disability parking close to the entrance of the festival. You will be allowed
    to park there after showing your personal parking card. Further, there will be
    dedicated toilets on site.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe are trying our best to make the festival
    accessible to all, but we cannot guarantee that moving around in a wheelchair
    will be easy (grass, etc). \r\n\nThere are risks of getting stuck (risk of entanglement?)
    if it rains, because the ground is not hard.\n\n \n\nFor more information, please
    contact us on info@paradisecity.be"
  question: IS THE FESTIVAL WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY?
- answer: Yes, at the entrance. We provide lockers to keep your stuff safe, for €7-10

    Please check our page transport for this matter : <https://paradisecity.be/transport>

    It goes without saying that we recommend you to use your bike or public transport to get to the festival. The bike racks will be lit at night.

    Go to http://fietsnet.be and follow the junctions to our festival, from your location. Our festival is located in Perk, right next to junction 56.

    Whilst on the road you don’t have to worry about anything but to follow the signs on your chosen route to the festival.
  question: HOW DO I GET TO PARADISE CITY?
- answer: "There will be buses coming from different cities in Belgium, here are the
    schedules for the weekend. Please make sure you are present at least 15 minutes
    before departure. \n\nYou need to buy a ticket for these busses: <https://shop.paylogic.com/122150/17501/add-ons>\n\n![null](/images/uploads/tableau.png)\n\n![null](/images/uploads/tableau-–-424234.png)"

    This year we're working with our partner **Brussels Airport** who will provide electric shuttle busses that will bring you from the **Vilvoorde train station** to our doors. The return shuttles will bring you to **Vilvoorde train station & Brussels Airport train station**.

  question: WHERE CAN I BUY TICKETS?
- answer: "Yes of course… if you don’t go. The ticket doesn’t have to be registered
    in your name or match your identification. There is only one rule: one ticket
    = one person. \n\nNote that your Wristband is not transferable (don’t think you
    can share it with your BF).\n\nIf you want to sell your ticket to a friend, no
    problem."
  question: CAN I SHARE MY TICKET WITH A FRIEND?
- answer: You can buy tickets for someone else. Note that there is a limit of 10 tickets
    per order.
  question: HOW MANY TICKETS CAN I ORDER?
- answer: Yes, you’ll be able to buy ticket at the entrance if Paradise City is not
    sold out. Last year Saturday was sold out, so we recommend buying your ticket
    upfront. Also, tickets will be 10euro more expensive at the door. Just so you
    know.
  question: IS THERE A TICKET OFFICE  AT THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: You can buy your tickets for the afterparty for Sunday. Also many unofficial
    afterparties are happening in Perk on Friday and Saturday.
  question: DOES MY TICKET TAKE ME TO THE AFTERPARTY?
- answer: "Nope! Everybody’s welcome at Paradise City Festival and kids below 12 years
    even enter free of charge. However, all kids below 18 have to be accompanied by
    their parents.  \n\nAlcohol will only be sold to people over 18! \n\nPlease mind
    their ears and provide protection for the younger once. We have free earplugs
    available at the festival.\n\nAlthough Paradise City is free for kids under 12,
    please be aware that the festival has been conceived for adults. And activities
    for children are limited."
  question: IS THERE A MINIMUM AGE?
money:
- answer: |-
    At the entrance of Paradise City, we will scan and link your ticket to your wristband. Once it is activated you can check in and check out at the festival during your stay by scanning your wristband with one of our Staff members.

    To charge your wristband with credit you can use one of our many cash desks, special unmanned Cashless Top-ups, or you can even charge your wristband with our Paradise City APP (which you’ll be able to download on the Apple Store and Play Store soon).

    When you want to have a cool drink, or buy some food at one of our delicious food trucks, you just have to scan your wristband at one of our bars/food trucks, it’s as simple as that! Note that we use reusable cups and that they have a recoverable deposit.
  question: ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WITH WRISTBAND? WHY ELECTRONIC PAYMENT? HOW DOES IT
    WORK?
- answer: |-
    This year we have 3 magnificent charging options for you:

    1. You can go to one of our cash desks, which are spread across the festival ground. Here you can pay with cash or card.
    2. Use one of our unmanned cashless top-up machines (card only) where you can charge your wristband very quickly.
    3. Just as last year you can charge your wristband with our Paradise City app. Just login, create/link your account, add your payment method (Payconiq, VISA, etc) and you’re good to go. More information about the app can be found soon on our website and at the festival itself.
  question: HOW DO I CHARGE MY PARADISE CITY WRISTBAND DURING THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: After every order you place at a bar, your left over credits will be shown
    on the device. If for some reason you forget how many credits you have left, just
    go to a bar or cash desk and ask one of our crew members.
  question: ALL RIGHT, BUT HOW DO I KNOW HOW MANY CREDITS ARE LEFT ON MY WRISTBAND?
- answer: |-
    If you still have some money left on your wristband after the festival, you can simply ask for a refund on our website after the festival. More information on how and where to get your refund will be given after the festival.

    New this year is that you will also be able to donate your credits that are left on your wristband to a good cause.

    Note: If you would like to get a refund, please be aware that there will be a small service fee charged.
  question: SO, CAN I RECOVER THE MONEY REMAINING ON THE WRISTBAND WHEN I LEAVE THE
    FESTIVAL?
- answer: No but for your own safety the maximum amount you can recharge at once is
    450 euros.
  question: IS THERE A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT I CAN RECHARGE?
- answer: Yes you can!
  question: CAN I CHARGE MY WRISTBAND AT THE CAMPSITE?
- answer: "Every time you leave Paradise City and you want to come back the same day,
    you’ll have to check yourself out at the exit. This can be done easily: scan your
    wristband on the black boxes found at the exit, and the trick is done. \n\nIt
    is your responsibility to check yourself out! Failing to do so may give you problems
    when checking back in the same day. \n\nOnce you are ready to go to sleep, at
    the end of a beautiful day full of partying, you can exit the festival without
    checking yourself – we will reset all access control and you can scan your wristband
    the next day, if you bought a ticket of course… \U0001F609"
  question: DO I NEED TO CHECK-OUT EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE FESTIVAL?
safety:
- answer: "There is a first aid station permanently present on site, clearly marked
    on the festival terrain and map. Please be aware that these people stand in for
    your safety and the safety of your loved ones, so it’s highly recommended to follow
    their instructions carefully. \n\nThe Security team is also available on and around
    the festival."
  question: HOW ABOUT SECURITY AND FIRST AID ON AND AROUND THE FESTIVAL PREMISES?
- answer: Even if we limit the decibels, think about your ears. Earplugs are available
    for free at the information booth. We count on you to throw them in the bin and
    not on the floor as they take forever to degrade. If you are looking for reusable
    earplugs specially designed for listening to live music, then BLOX has what you
    are looking for. You can find earplugs with acoustic filters via their mobile
    team walking around the scenes. Enjoy a crystal-clear sound while protecting your
    ears. More info on www.blox.info
  question: ARE THERE EARPLUGS ON SITE?
- answer: Of course, if it’s legal medication.
  question: CAN I BRING MY MEDICATION?
- answer: 'Nope! Paradise City Festival holds a zero-tolerance drug policy on site.
    Same for your own alcohol: bars will be plentiful on site and at the camping.'
  question: SO, NO OTHER MEDICATIONS?
- answer: No, drugs are not allowed on the festival ground. Police will do searches
    at the entrance.
  question: OK SO NO DRUGS ALLOWED?
camping:
- answer: "We provide a campsite next to the festival grounds on the domain of Ribaucourt.\n\nParadise
    City is the first festival offering a comfortable and super sustainable camping
    experience. You can rent a tent on our webshop.(https://shop.paylogic.com/124808/17501/accommodation)\n\nIf
    you decide to bring your own, you’ll have to pay a warranty. At the end of the
    festival, you’ll get it back after we confirm that you left your camping place
    clean and tidy.  \n\nAs you may know, every year a lot of stuff is left behind
    on festival campsites after a festival is finished. This includes bottles and
    glasses, but also tents! To be more specific: 1 in 4 people leave their tent behind
    on the various campsites worldwide! People feel hungover and tired, and don’t
    feel like folding up their tent. As you can imagine this causes a lot of waste
    and it is not all too good for the environment… after only a single use all these
    tents will go to the garbage dump!\n\nNo worries, we’ve got you covered: meet
    our circular camping where each camper has the opportunity to rent recycled camping
    gear! How cool is that? \n\nTo access the campsite, you must be in possession
    of a valid camping wristband. You will receive your wristband at the campsite
    cash register."
  question: WHERE TO STAY DURING THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: Only on Holiday tickets. Not on Day and Weekend tickets. If you forgot to
    order your camping ticket, a camping upgrade is available.
  question: IS MY CAMPING TICKET INCLUDED IN MY FESTIVAL TICKET?
- answer: "On our campsite you can take a hot shower and use toilets. You will also
    find what you need to do your dishes and recycle your waste!\n\nHungry after a
    day of partying? Breakfast is available on the island at Brasserie 2050: on Saturday
    and Sunday from 08.00h till 12.00h and on Monday from 08.00h until 11.00h. \n\nOur
    camping crew will be at your disposal to answer all your questions and needs (hospitality
    desk), and the security will also look after you."

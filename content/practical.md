  question: WHAT ARE THE FESTIVAL OPENING HOURS?

  question: WHERE CAN I FIND THE LINE-UP?

    disability parking close to the entrance of the festival. You will be allowed
    to park there after showing your personal parking card. Further, there will be
    dedicated toilets on site.\n\nWe are trying our best to make the festival accessible
    to all, but we cannot guarantee that moving around in a wheelchair will be easy
    (grass, etc). \n\nThere are risks of getting stuck if it rains, because the ground
    is not hard.\n\nFor more information, please contact us on info@paradisecity.be"

    in your name or match your identification. There is only one rule: one ticket
    = one person. Note that your Wristband is not transferable (don’t think you can
    share it with your BF).If you want to sell your ticket to a friend, no problem.'

  question: I'VE LOST MY TICKET, WHAT CAN I DO?
- answer: Yes, you’ll be able to buy ticket at the entrance if Paradise City is not
    sold out. Saturday was sold out last year, so we recommend buying your ticket
    upfront. Also, tickets will be 10euro more expensive at the door. Just so you
    know.
  question: IS THERE A TICKET OFFICE  AT THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: 'Your ticket is not valid for our nightprogram in C12. You have to buy a
    seperate ticket for it in our shop. Please present yourself at the entrance with
    your festival bracelet otherwise you''ll have to pay an extra 5€.  '

    even enter free of charge. However, all kids below 18 have to be accompanied by
    their parents.  \n\nAlcohol will only be sold to people over 18! \n\nPlease mind
    their ears and provide protection for the younger once. We have free earplugs
    available at the festival.\n\nAlthough Paradise City is free for kids under 12,
    please be aware that the festival has been conceived for adults. And activities
    for children are limited."
  question: IS THERE A MINIMUM AGE?
money:
- answer: |-
    At the entrance of Paradise City, we will scan and link your ticket to your wristband. Once it is activated you can check in and check out at the festival during your stay by scanning your wristband with one of our Staff members.

    To charge your wristband with credit you can use one of our many cash desks, special unmanned Cashless Top-ups, or you can even charge your wristband with our Paradise City APP (which you’ll be able to download on the Apple Store and Play Store soon).

    When you want to have a cool drink, or buy some food at one of our delicious food trucks, you just have to scan your wristband at one of our bars/food trucks, it’s as simple as that! Note that we use reusable cups and that they have a recoverable deposit.
  question: ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WITH WRISTBAND? WHY ELECTRONIC PAYMENT? HOW DOES IT
    WORK?
- answer: |-
    This year we have 3 magnificent charging options for you:

    1. You can go to one of our cash desks, which are spread across the festival ground. Here you can pay with cash or card.
    2. Use one of our unmanned cashless top-up machines (card only) where you can charge your wristband very quickly.
    3. Just as last year you can charge your wristband with our Paradise City app. Just login, create/link your account, add your payment method (Payconiq, VISA, etc) and you’re good to go. More information about the app can be found soon on our website and at the festival itself.
  question: HOW DO I CHARGE MY PARADISE CITY WRISTBAND DURING THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: After every order you place at a bar, your left over credits will be shown
    on the device. If for some reason you forget how many credits you have left, just
    go to a bar or cash desk and ask one of our crew members.
  question: ALL RIGHT, BUT HOW DO I KNOW HOW MANY CREDITS ARE LEFT ON MY WRISTBAND?
- answer: |-
    If you still have some money left on your wristband after the festival, you can simply ask for a refund on our website after the festival. More information on how and where to get your refund will be given after the festival.

    New this year is that you will also be able to donate your credits that are left on your wristband to a good cause.

    Note: If you would like to get a refund, please be aware that there will be a small service fee charged.
  question: SO, CAN I RECOVER THE MONEY REMAINING ON THE WRISTBAND WHEN I LEAVE THE
    FESTIVAL?
- answer: No but for your own safety the maximum amount you can recharge at once is
    450 euros.
  question: IS THERE A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT I CAN RECHARGE?
- answer: Yes you can!
  question: CAN I CHARGE MY WRISTBAND AT THE CAMPSITE?
- answer: "Every time you leave Paradise City and you want to come back the same day,
    you’ll have to check yourself out at the exit. This can be done easily: scan your
    wristband on the black boxes found at the exit, and the trick is done. \n\nIt
    is your responsibility to check yourself out! Failing to do so may give you problems
    when checking back in the same day. \n\nOnce you are ready to go to sleep, at
    the end of a beautiful day full of partying, you can exit the festival without
    checking yourself – we will reset all access control and you can scan your wristband
    the next day, if you bought a ticket of course… \U0001F609"
  question: DO I NEED TO CHECK-OUT EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE FESTIVAL?
safety:
- answer: "There is a first aid station permanently present on site, clearly marked
    on the festival terrain and map. Please be aware that these people stand in for
    your safety and the safety of your loved ones, so it’s highly recommended to follow
    their instructions carefully. \n\nThe Security team is also available on and around
    the festival."
  question: HOW ABOUT SECURITY AND FIRST AID ON AND AROUND THE FESTIVAL PREMISES?
- answer: Even if we limit the decibels, think about your ears. Earplugs are available
    for free at the information booth. We count on you to throw them in the bin and
    not on the floor as they take forever to degrade. If you are looking for reusable
    earplugs specially designed for listening to live music, then BLOX has what you
    are looking for. You can find earplugs with acoustic filters via their mobile
    team walking around the scenes. Enjoy a crystal-clear sound while protecting your
    ears. More info on www.blox.info
  question: ARE THERE EARPLUGS ON SITE?
- answer: Of course, if it’s legal medication.
  question: CAN I BRING MY MEDICATION?
- answer: 'Nope! Paradise City Festival holds a zero-tolerance drug policy on site.
    Same for your own alcohol: bars will be plentiful on site and at the camping.'
  question: SO, NO OTHER MEDICATIONS?
- answer: No, drugs are not allowed on the festival ground. Police will do searches
    at the entrance.
  question: OK SO NO DRUGS ALLOWED?
camping:
- answer: "We provide a campsite next to the festival grounds on the domain of Ribaucourt.\n\nAs
    you may know, every year a lot of stuff is left behind on festival campsites after
    a festival is finished. This includes bottles and glasses, but also tents! To
    be more specific: 1 in 4 people leave their tent behind on the various campsites
    worldwide! People feel hungover and tired, and don’t feel like folding up their
    tent. As you can imagine this causes a lot of waste and it is not all too good
    for the environment… after only a single use all these tents will go to the garbage
    dump!\n\nNo worries, we’ve got you covered: meet our circular camping where each
    camper has the opportunity to rent recycled camping gear! How cool is that? \n\nTo
    access the campsite, you must be in possession of a valid camping wristband. You
    will receive your wristband at the campsite cash register.\n\nMore info on our
    Camping page!"
  question: WHERE TO STAY DURING THE FESTIVAL?
- answer: Only on Holiday tickets. Not on Day and Weekend tickets. If you forgot to
    order your camping ticket, a camping upgrade is available.
  question: IS MY CAMPING TICKET INCLUDED IN MY FESTIVAL TICKET?
- answer: "On our campsite you can take a hot shower and use toilets. You will also
    find what you need to do your dishes and recycle your waste!\n\nHungry after a
    day of partying? Breakfast will be available on the camping site. \n\nOur camping
    crew will be at your disposal to answer all your questions and needs (hospitality
    desk), and the security will also look after you."
  question: ARE THERE CAMPING FACILITIES INCLUDED?
- answer: 'Check-in: Continuously from Friday June 26th, starting at 14.00h. Check-out:
    Monday, June 29th, before 12h00.'

    of brands. You can smoke on site, and we will give away free pocket ashtrays!
    So PLEASE, PLEASE, place your cigarette butts inside! \n\nOne thing is forbidden:
    smoking in our tents!"
  question: CAN I BUY CIGARETTES? CAN I SMOKE ON SITE?

    a lens or a phone display. \n\nPlease know that by entering the festival, you

    people, so mutual respect and respect for the environment is essential to be a
    good Citizen. We have zero tolerance on violence and intimidating behaviour, discrimination
    and sexual intimidation. \n\nWeapons, knife, glass, spray cans, cans, fireworks
    and umbrellas are not permitted. We are in a magnificent park, please be responsible
    and throw your garbage in the trash cans. And we expect each Citizen to treat
    it with respect. Any behaviour that can damage the domain will not be tolerated.
    \n\nDrugs. We also have a zero-tolerance policy on drugs. You’ll be extensively

greencard:
  question: ''
  answer: ''
green_card:
- question: What's a green card?
  answer: If you’re a loyal citizen and you came already to one of the previous editions
    of Paradise City festival, you received a Green card. A Green Card is a leaflet
    with a code inside. This code gives you a reduction on your ticket. Inside, there
    are also other surprises!
- question: How can I receive a green card?
  answer: You only receive a Green Card if you already came to one of the previous
    editions of Paradise City Festival. After buying a ticket, you’ll be registered
    in our database and from then on you’ll receive your personal Green Card each
    year.
- question: 'HOW LONG CAN I USE MY GREEN CARD CODE? '
  answer: You can use your Green Card code until Wednesday 22th of April at 23:59.
- question: WHAT CAN I DO IF MY GREEN CARD CODE DOESN’T WORK?
  answer: Be sure you copy the code without any space before or after the code. Be
    aware to not confuse a 0 (figure) and O (letter). If you return to a previous
    page after entering your code, an error message can appear. No worries, after
    30 minutes your code will work again!
- question: UNTIL WHEN ARE THE EARLY BIRD TICKETS AVAILABLE?
  answer: Early bird tickets are available until Wednesday 22th of April at 23:59.
    After that time, the ticket price will be the final price, so no more reduction.
- question: WHAT' S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GREEN CARD AND AN EARLY BIRD TICKET?
  answer: A Green Card gives you a reduction because you already came to a previous
    edition of the festival. An Early Bird ticket also gives you a reduction but only
    because you buy it earlier.
covid:
- question: When will Paradise City take place in 2021?
  answer: Dates for 2021 are 25, 26 & 27th of June.

    need to do anything, just keep your tickets in your mailbox.

    how can I do that?
  answer: If you want to come next year but you are not sure which day or if you want
    to switch to the full journey, you will be able to request a voucher. That voucher
    will have the same value as your ticket and you’ll be able to buy a ticket on
    our 2021 ticket shop with it. Our ticket partner Paylogic is currently developing
    the voucher functionality. They are attempting to handle this as quickly and properly
    as possible. We will keep you updated on this in the coming weeks when the system
    will be ready.
- question: 'When will this voucher option be available? '
  answer: Our ticket partner Paylogic is currently working on this solution and it
    should be ready in about 2 weeks. Once the interface is ready, you’ll be able
    to request your voucher and you’ll receive it in June.
- question: Can I choose the voucher option for each ticket, or will it be applied
    to all the tickets I purchased?
  answer: No worries, you can choose the voucher option per ticket.

Or:la first burst onto the production scene in 2016 after her debut release, 'UK Lonely' on Hotflush Recordings. What separates Or:la from many other young DJ's at the moment is a vast knowledge of various genres and tempos. Her success as a dynamic producer and genre-spanning selector has seen her gain a residency at the Warehouse Project in Manchester, a bimonthly show on NTS Radio and she has been rewarded by DJ Mag as ‘Breakthrough DJ of the year’ in 2017.

In 2019 she launched her new label imprint 'Céad', on which she releases music of her own alongside select newcomers. Catch her on the Hangar Stage on Friday!

Kruder & Dorfmeister started making music together in the early 1990s. At the time, Vienna was a metropolis of the aspiring techno movement. But the two gentlemen rather followed the tradition of the continental cosmic “dancefloor” of the 1980s. K&D always enjoyed not following advice and abandoned all of the enticing major offers. Instead, they provided musician friends with distribution on their G-Stone label, hung out in the studio and put together follow-up projects, like Dorfmeister & Huber’s Tosca or Kruder’s Peace Orchestra. To this day the two still maintain an open concept, influenced by a wide-ranging taste in music and their ability to hear music, to feel and to be able to realize their musical conceptions. So, the two are happiest when people take their music and their DJ sets for what they are: odes to hearing, feeling, sensing music and tonal language, which does not function like the many spoken languages of the world, but rather as body language: universal, global, unifying.

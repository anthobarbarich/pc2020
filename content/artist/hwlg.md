Though they come from quite opposite ends of the spectrum, there’s a tangible sense of understanding and appreciation between singer/producer/cult artist Ry X and producer/live electronic artist/label owner Frank Wiedemann. Ry X and Frank’s musical influences are remarkably aligned, as are their creative mindsets. Both artists’ backgrounds meld together to create productions that transcend categorization: subtle yet deeply moving songs that glisten with divine instrumentation and percussion. They often use the word “magic” when describing their productions, live performances and the project as a whole. And for good reason: there’s a special sense of happenstance and symbiosis to everything surrounding Howling.

After getting to know each other in Zürich in 2008, Adrian Shala & Adrian Schweizer became inseparable, not just as friends, but also as artists. The two men carved out a career as one of the most consistently delivering DJ/producer duos in the house and techno scene: Adriatique. Their respective preference for studio work and performance means that both aspects are equally well covered. Their performances as well as their productions are long, meditative, relentlessly building affairs, ever challenging the listener with subtle twists interrupting their hypnotic groove. In 2016, they launched Siamese, their own music label annex platform for the arts where music should be meditation. Wanna take a trip in their world?

The term 'legend' is often banded around willy nilly in the dance music realm, but Mr. G, aka Colin McBean, is one of the few who can rightfully lay claim to this accolade. Having been in the game for around 2 decades now, Mr. G is widely considered to be one of the most under-rated artists about - with only true music fans appreciating his vast contribution to dance music. Having achieved great acclaim for releases on labels such as Defected, Duty Free, The End and Skint/Loaded, and remixing a wide range of artists, he also received much attention for his releases/remixes out of Detroit on Moods ‘n’ Grooves.

Mr. G’ sets went down a treat, tantalizing crowds with his trademark blend of analogue driven grooves and luscious, soulful soundscapes. His live sets are now becoming legendary, along with a string of fresh material and remixes in the pipeline.

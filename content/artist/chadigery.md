Having been taught the ropes by her mother, from rhythm over musicality to a sense of humour and not taking herself too seriously, Charlotte Adigéry got into music from an early age. Through mutual friends (after all Belgium is a tiny country) she was asked by the Soulwax brothers to lip-sync a song of theirs for the 'Belgica' soundtrack they were producing at the time. As soon as they heard her voice, the acting job quickly turned into a studio session... and another... and another.

Charlotte Adigéry's music making is all about playing around until she hits a nerve and something feel-good starts bubbling up - following that vein wherever it may lead. So, yes, this could be called experimental, but not as a reference to the genre. More like: if we put Mentos in a Coke bottle and shook it for 32 seconds, would it explode?

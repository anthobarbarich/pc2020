When it comes to house music there’s been something of a renaissance in New York City this past decade and one of its main advocates is Levon Vincent. As a clubgoer, he cut his teeth during the pre-Giuliani New York heyday, where a vibrant scene was helping to push the elegant sound that would become known as NY house forward – and Levon witnessed it all first-hand. Levon joined a long, proud lineage of fringe arts based around New York’s downtown culture.

By 2008, Levon began his own label, Novel Sound. He started with a bang: a certified hit in the form of the label’s first release, ‘These Games’ EP. The following years were marked by extensive touring, with successful gigs at reknown clubs and festivals alike. Levon released his critically acclaimed third album 'World Order Music' in November 2019.

Intimate setting on the Giegling Stage is ready for him on Saturday night!

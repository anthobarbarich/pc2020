Move D, aka David Moufang, is one of the modern electronic music most beloved souls with a long and varied musical history with roots in the 60s and 70s jazz, psychedelic, rock, soul and early electronica. Making his first appearance on vinyl as part of a school bands competition in 1983, it was only another four years before he started toying with the medium as a DJ, playing funk, soul, hip-hop, and proto-house. In the 90s things began to move fast with the inception of his Source Records imprint, early productions and the beginnings of a 26 album relationship with a close friend, the late Pete Namlook. Since then, Move D has become an unassuming heavyweight in house music as a producer for countless forward-thinking labels, a collaborator and a truly original selector.

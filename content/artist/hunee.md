Every DJ would like to think themselves a real musical connoisseur, but Hunee really is - it’s not him that says so, but pretty much anyone else whenever the man born Hun Choi pops up in conversation. His DJ sets have of course taken him all over the world but they take listeners much further. As likely to draw for a classic house record as he is a disco curveball, a boogie delight or mixing an African bomb into a techno record, each selection he makes is a thing of true passion. Hunee’s sole goal is to enrich the lives of listeners as much as possible. “I just try to do my own thing” he says humbly, and no-one could argue with that. Hunee will bless the audience with a 3-hour set of soul infused house, what a better way to close the festival?

No one unites a club like Kerri Chandler. No one’s kick kicks harder. No one’s keys carry more emotion. No crowd reacts with more energy than when the New Jersey great is behind the decks. His life-long obsession with sound makes him famously meticulous about the setups of the clubs he plays, and that always results in electrifying sets of soulful, authentic, positive house music. Rather than mechanical grooves, he lays down spiritual rhythms that permeate every part of your body. He combines powerful, driving drums with heart swelling hooks to devastating effect. Chandler has unquestionably helped shape the house landscape. His Kaoz Theory label has worked with contemporary talents, while his influential MadHouse Records has just celebrated 25 years of agenda setting releases with a storytelling anniversary album. He has been a house legend for many years, but what sets him apart is his unique ability to blend tradition with innovation in fascinating new ways.

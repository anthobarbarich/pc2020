The S.A.M. sound has been characterized as cosmic, trippy, spiritual, psychedelic, peaceful, and groovy. It’s the combination of these attributes with the playfully danceable beats and smiling performances that has brought S.A.M. to be one of the most interesting underground acts of today. Samuel Andre Madsen grew up in a religious family in the countryside of Denmark, helping out in church playing the drums and bass guitar. Later when he moved to Copenhagen, he met electronic music, and started producing and DJ’ing while studying Theology at the University and working as a church keeper on the side. S.A.M.’s goal is to intensify his act on stage and in the studio.

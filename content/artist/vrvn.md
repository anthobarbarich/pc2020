For as long as Eli Verveine has been mixing records she has strived for the perfect groove and flow, the one that keeps you moving and the dancefloor rocking. After two decades, thousands of satisfied dancers will happily testify to her uncanny knack of finding and working that groove. Since honing her skills over years warming up the dancefloor, she has developed into a superlative peak-time DJ who also still loves to play extended after-hours sets. Her sound is timeless, a smoothly-blended mix of deeper house and techno from two weeks or two decades ago that's always warm, groovy and tastefully euphoric.

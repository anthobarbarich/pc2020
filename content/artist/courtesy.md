Najaaraq Vestbirk, aka Courtesy, is a DJ and label owner from Denmark. Pursuing and finding rare success solely as a DJ means she’s invested fully in her craft. Endless hours digging in the more overlooked sections of the world’s record shops while championing the newest music coming out of her Copenhagen hometown has resulted in a unique and thrilling sound. Her sets are as much for the head as they are the body – a place where fast, streamlined stompers sit alongside whip-crack electro and churning, wrongspeed EBM – held together by a common thread of smart and emotive melody. As for Courtesy, she'll awaken our souls with a legendary performance as she usually does.

Field Recordings, percussion, electronic spice and acoustic instruments. These are the ingredients chosen to create the perfect Belgian Bolivian. His didactic study for percussion and rhythm was the focus of his new album “La Hoja de Eucalipto” that brings alive a more active and aggressive part of Susobrino. The Bolivian Indiana Jones presented his first serene EP “Mapajo” in 2018. An EP fully made of his field recording trip to Bolivia. Since then he achieved a double win for the “Champion Sound Beat Battle” and got “Most Promising Artist” at the Red Bull Elektropedia Awards. He will play on Saturday on the Paradise City Live Stage!

Lola Haro is all about crazy bangers. Her love and passion for music and her authentic approach have been refreshing and gave her a lot of recognition on the Belgian club scene. In only 12 months’ time, she earned a residency at Paradise City Festival and Kiosk Radio, got her first Boiler Room under her belt, shared the DJ booth with countless highly respected international selectors and was awarded as “Most Promising artist of 2019” by Red Bull Elektropedia.

It has been several years now that ​Mézigue has been inviting himself into the lives of those who wanted to see him. Adept of Mézigue himself, he draws his inspiration from French slang, concrete, nature and the emptiness that constitutes everything. Mézigue does not like talking about Mézigue, he’s the one who wrote this biography and he prefers to keep it confidential.

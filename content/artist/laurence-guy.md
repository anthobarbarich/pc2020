DJ, Producer and purveyor of quality house music, UK artist Laurence Guy has amassed a collection of loyal listeners and tastemakers. From his album on Church Records in 2017 through to his Mule Musiq EP and 2019 mini-album on Studio Barnhus, Guyâ€™s mature and seasoned releases have been consistently acclaimed whilst stylistically diverse. A restless digger, Laurence can also be found rummaging through the dusty crates of his local record shops, informing the sound of his refined DJ sets, edits label Accidental Pieces and Rinse FM residency. He will play a live set on Saturday on the Paradise City Live Stage.

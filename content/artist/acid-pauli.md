Over the last 20 years Martin Gretschmann has been exploring new fields of music off the mainstream paths: psychedelic, adventurous and full of musicality. With his solo project Acid Pauli he created several records, remixes and podcast in the last couple of years. Furthermore he took part in the unique project - The Golden Machine - a specifically developed electronic device which over the course of a whole year continuously produced music for a radio play, based on - Infinite Jest- by David Foster Wallace. In 2016 he released his most popular track 'Nana' on the first label compilation of Pampa Records. Martin always explores new ways to express himself. For the fans of the downtempo and blissful vibes, Acid Pauli is not to miss during the sunset.

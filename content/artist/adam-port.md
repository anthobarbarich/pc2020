Over the last years, Adam Port landed a string of much noticed releases on different labels, be it on Keinemusik, his Berlin-based label-mainstay and collective. And instead of doing the obvious, getting a management, meeting demands, playing those big stages, delivering the hits, Adam did what felt best for him. Maintaining artistic integrity, releasing records that reflect where his love for music is at in one moment, not knowing where it might be on the very next release, and keeping DJ-sets not only interesting for a crowd, but also himself. That’s where he is at right now. There’s no scene-dictated tunnel view in his activities, there is only a pointed emphasis on style, on groove and sophistication. An emphasis, that, because it’s informed by Dub, Danchall, Rap, Soul or even Psychedelic Rock, is advanced enough to always shine through the inflationary characteristic of the genre as notably original.

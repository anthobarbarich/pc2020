There is a remarkable elegance to the way Lawrence found his space as an artist in the universe of subtle House and deep Techno. Lawrence produces, djs and on rare occasions plays live. Doing this for almost two decades, he's released a considerable number of records on his co-owned labels Dial and Smallville along with releases on Mule Musiq, Pampa, Ghostly International and others. His last album “Illusion” (Dial, 2018) is dedicated to the passionate underground scene with its old and new originators. With the Sky Walking imprint Lawrence aka Peter Kersten currently launched a platform for experimental and improvised music.

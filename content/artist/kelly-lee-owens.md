Kelly Lee Owens' masterful second album “Inner Song” finds the convention-blurring techno producer and singer/songwriter diving deep into her own psyche-excoriating the struggles she's faced over the last several years and exploring personal pain while embracing the beauty of the natural world. It's a leap in artistry from a musician who burst forth on the scene with a confident, rich sound, and is endlessly enticing when it comes to what Owens is capable of. Her latest album also comes off of what Owens describes as "the hardest three years of my life," an emotionally fraught time that, in her words, “definitely impacted my creative life and everything I'd worked for up to that point. I wasn't sure if I could make anything anymore, and it took quite a lot of courage to get to a point where I could make something again."

She will play her live show on Saturday on the Paradise City Live Stage!

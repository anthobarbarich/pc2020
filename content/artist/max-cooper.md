Few have been so successful in interrogating and furthering the intersection between electronic music, visual art, technology and science in the past decade as Max Cooper. Whether a walk-through light installation, ground-breaking use of 4D sound, or club-ready techno releases, Cooper’s output is a classic case of electronic exploration that makes use of available technology while referencing that which came before it and does so in a human way. What now drives the Belfast-born artist as he set out on a fresh cycle for his fourth studio album _Yearning for the Infinite_ was to create a lasting human impression through technology and machinery. Synthesising his interests and presenting it in an accessible way that defies conventional format, Cooper explores concepts of emergence, identity and infinity to create an immersion of sound, vision and concept that can totally remove you from your normal experience of reality and put you somewhere new. At the core, Max Cooper’s mission as a musician, a DJ and an interdisciplinary artist is all about provoking a greater understanding.

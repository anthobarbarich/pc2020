Dance producers nowadays are inclined to go on stage with a laptop under their arm and then stare at the screen. Not Andy Jenkinson, alias Ceephax Acid Crew. Ceephax drags his studio to every performance, puts a stack of drum computers and synths on stage and every track is performed live. While he scatters his acid over the audience, he also wants to have a conversation with them. Fuck Laptops! This is the real shit. No notebooks for this old-school Acid producer who brings drums and synths to every gig and performs all of them live.

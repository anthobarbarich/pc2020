Gidge is a duo consisting of Jonatan Nilsson and Ludvig Stolterman from Umeå, a city in the north of Sweden. Jonatan and Ludvig met in school and had a mutual interest for electronic music. After taking a sound production class, they started producing music. Using the woods and widths of the North as their main source of inspiration, the music of Gidge sounds like a mixture of electronic music and organic elements, such as wooden and stone percussions that the duo recorded in the forests outside of Umeå. Together with melancholic vocal samples and warm, fuzzy chord progressions, the music of Gidge seems to affect their audience in an emotional way.

The last time Axel Boman had his biography written for him, he had just graduated from the Red Bull Music Academy, released his Purple Drank EP on DJ Koze’s Pampa label and was looking forward to releases on Permanent Vacation, Moodmusic and Hypercolour. The future looked promising. This rise in popularity could be down to his dashing good looks or smiley personality. But it could be down to his highly esteemed label, Studio Barnhus (he co-runs with Kornél Kovács and Pedrodollar) which has been responsible for presenting the most exciting house music around today. And his impressive work ethic might be what explains Axel's popularity the best. The Swedish bundle of joy has joined the ranks of the most in demand DJ’s in house music.

Frank Wiedemann is part of the duo Âme. The two friends meet outside Karlsruhe, in Schwarzwald. One is an explorer of galaxies far away, the other a composer of fragments. This stone world is made of smooth subterranean rock that swirls and folds. Altered from its original igneous by pressures a hundred thousand years strong. What was once sharp is now smooth. Lines become curves, reversals. If you were to try read its origin, its strata, you would not tell which direction the past flowed or the future began.

Âme’s singularity is derived from their strata – a catacomb of Frank Wiedemann and Kristian Beyer’s symbiotic relationship. They are not so much defined from their past but by what is to come. Frank is the composer and creative engine behind the live act. His dense production turned tangible. From influence to influential, like atoms repeating an ancient structure, each entity shares Frank and Kristian’s defining characteristics. Each new foray into the industry is beleaguered by the same attention to detail and continual exploration of the music universe in that it is also revered.

Andras is the stage name of Andrew Wilson (1988), an Australian musician who’s earned acclaim for his unpredictable take on dance music. His soft focused abstractions cut a broad path through ‘90s underground house, soundtrack and ambient music. His work is loosely based around drum machine rhythms and soft synthesis; smoothing over nature-machine and industrial-relaxation binaries and enjoying the slippage.

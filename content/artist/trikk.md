One of Porto’s finest exports, Trikk was praised as a young talent and embraced by so many as new star to look out for. After releasing on labels such ManMakeMusic and Lossless and remixes for Hotflush Recordings, Pets Recordings and more, nothing was left to prove. As a personal challenge, he moved to London where he now spends his days producing music and djing. Trikk explores mainly house aesthetics in complex tracks, wisely composed. He is fast, slow, rough and smooth all at the same time.

Seemingly out of nothing, through dust and with no bang, Vril appeared on the scene. His music made such beautiful noise that it instantly found his place on Marcel Dettmann’s selection for his Conducted cd and on Ostgut’s release schedule. His sound is a search for the evergoing movement, exploring a never stopping energy. Once he catches you in his groove it will shine so bright you won’t be able to escape it.

Tales of his live sets being heard at the Fusion Festival and the Berghain all share the same common feature that it was an as euphoric as energetic travel in sound.
